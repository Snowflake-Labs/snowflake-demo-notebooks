   "source": "# Effortless and Trusted Anomaly Detection with Snowflake ML Functions\n\nAnomaly detection is the process of identifying **outliers** in data, especially in **time-series** datasets where data points are indexed over time. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from expected patterns and, if unaddressed, can distort **statistical analyses** and models. By detecting and removing anomalies, we improve the accuracy and reliability of our models. The process typically involves training a model on historical data to recognize normal patterns and using that model to spot data points that fall outside of these patterns. Anomaly detection improves **data integrity**\n\nThis Notebook is designed to help you get up to speed with Anomaly Detection ML Functions in Snowflake ([link](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ml-functions/anomaly-detection)). We will work through an example using data from a bank marketing dataset ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)). We will build an anomaly detection model to understand if certain education groups have anomalies regarding the duration of the last contact by the bank. We will wrap up this Notebook by showcasing how you can use **Tasks** to schedule your model training process and utilize the email notification integration to send out a report on trending food items.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

   "source": "# Step 1: Setting Up Snowflake Environment\n\nBefore working with data in Snowflake, it's essential to set up the **necessary infrastructure**. This includes defining user roles, creating a database and schema for organizing data, and setting up a compute warehouse to process queries efficiently. The following steps ensure that the environment is correctly configured:\n\n- **Assign Role:** First, use the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role, which has the highest level of access in Snowflake. This ensures that you have the necessary permissions to create and modify databases, schemas, and warehouses. If a different role has sufficient privileges, it can be used instead.  \n\n- **Create Database and Schema:** A **database** is where all your data is stored, and a **schema** helps organize different tables and objects within the database. In this setup, we create a database named `fawazghali_db` and a schema called `fawazghali_schema`. The `OR REPLACE` option ensures that if they already exist, they are replaced with fresh instances.  \n\n- **Select Database and Schema:** To make sure all subsequent SQL commands operate within the correct context, we explicitly set `fawazghali_db` as the active database and `fawazghali_schema` as the active schema. This avoids confusion and ensures that queries and table creations happen in the right location.  \n\n- **Create and Use Warehouse:** A **warehouse** in Snowflake is a virtual compute engine that processes queries and computations. We create a warehouse named `fawazghali_wh`, replacing any existing instance. After creation, we set it as the active warehouse to ensure all queries utilize this compute resource efficiently.  \n\nBy completing these setup steps, Snowflake is properly configured, allowing for smooth data storage, retrieval, and processing. 🚀  \n"

This stage will be used to load data into Snowflake.\n\n- **Stage Name**: `s3_fawazghali_load`\n- **Comment**: A description for the stage connection (e.g., \"fawazghali_db S3 Stage Connection\").\n- **S3 URL**: Specifies the location of the data on AWS S3 (e.g., `s3://sfquickstarts/hol_snowflake_cortex_ml_for_sql/`).\n- **File Format**: We specify the previously created file format (`csv_ff`) for reading CSV files. This ensures that the data will be processed correctly when loaded.\n\nThe external stage allows Snowflake to access the data in the specified S3 bucket and is an important step before ingesting the data into Snowflake tables."

The model is built using the following parameters:\n  - `INPUT_DATA`: The view `fawazghali_anomaly_training_set`, which contains the training data.\n  - `SERIES_COLNAME`: The column used for time series analysis, in this case, `EDUCATION`.\n  - `TIMESTAMP_COLNAME`: The column representing the timestamp, which is `TIMESTAMP`.\n  - `TARGET_COLNAME`: The target variable for anomaly detection, here it’s `DURATION`.\n  - `LABEL_COLNAME`: The column for labels (if available). In this case, it is left empty, implying the model is unsupervised, but labels could be passed if desired.\n\n- **Time Considerations**: The creation of the model might take a few minutes, depending on the size of the warehouse and data. Please be patient during this process.\n\nOnce the model is created, it will be ready to detect anomalies in future data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
