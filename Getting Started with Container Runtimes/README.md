# Getting Started with Notebooks on Container Runtimes

This example notebooks demonstrates how to get started using Snowflake's Container Runtime for Notebooks. It includes the setup, configuration, and execution of a straightforward machine learning training job.

For more info about the Notebooks Container runtime, check out:
- The [public documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowsight-notebooks/ui-snowsight-notebooks-runtime)
- An [overview presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pModfkpZuoAsKiYAYfpcO50PxaFB460VCO6qeM_S66s/edit#slide=id.g293d2d1b46a_1_87) of the notebooks container runtime

## Setup

**Note: as of July 15, 2024, the Notebooks Container Runtime is in Private Preview.** Make sure that your account is enabled for this Private Preview if you intend to run this example.

### Step 1 - SQL Setup Script

Run the following SQL code in a Snowflake SQL Worksheet to create the database objects, roles, privileges, and compute pools needed to run this example notebook.

The setup script is to be run by ACCOUNTADMIN. However, a different role needs to be used to create and author notebooks. This role cannot be ACCOUNTADMIN, SECURITYADMIN, or ORGADMIN. In the example, weâ€™re granting privileges to SYSADMIN which will then be used to create notebooks. Please choose a role that has the privilege of creating a table in a schema. 

```sql
------------------
-- DEMO STEP #1 --
------------------
-- General setup
use role accountadmin;
create database public;
create schema notebooks;

grant usage on database public to role sysadmin;
grant usage on schema public.notebooks to role sysadmin;
grant create stage on schema public.notebooks to role sysadmin;
grant create notebook on schema public.notebooks to role sysadmin;
grant create service on schema public.notebooks to role sysadmin;
grant usage on warehouse compute_wh to role sysadmin;

-- Create and grant access to compute pools
CREATE COMPUTE POOL CPU_XS_5_NODES
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 5
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_XS;

CREATE COMPUTE POOL GPU_S_5_NODES
  MIN_NODES = 1
  MAX_NODES = 5
  INSTANCE_FAMILY = GPU_NV_S;

grant usage on compute pool CPU_XS_5_NODES to role sysadmin;
grant usage on compute pool GPU_S_5_NODES to role sysadmin;

-- Create and grant access to EAIs
-- Substep #1: create network rules (these are schema-level objects; end users do not need direct access to the network rules)

create network rule allow_all_rule
  TYPE = 'HOST_PORT'
  MODE= 'EGRESS'
  VALUE_LIST = ('0.0.0.0:443','0.0.0.0:80');

-- Substep #2: create external access integration (these are account-level objects; end users need access to this to access the public internet with endpoints defined in network rules)

CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION allow_all_integration
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (allow_all_rule)
  ENABLED = true;

CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE pypi_network_rule
  MODE = EGRESS
  TYPE = HOST_PORT
  VALUE_LIST = ('pypi.org', 'pypi.python.org', 'pythonhosted.org',  'files.pythonhosted.org');

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION pypi_access_integration
  ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (pypi_network_rule)
  ENABLED = true;

Grant USAGE ON INTEGRATION allow_all_integration to ROLE sysadmin;
Grant USAGE ON INTEGRATION pypi_access_integration to ROLE sysadmin;
```

Additional information about compute pool configurations is available in [the documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool).

### Step 2 - Upload `diamonds.csv` Data

Next, we will upload the [diamonds.csv](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-demo-notebooks/tree/main/Getting%20Started%20with%Container%Runtimes/diamonds.csv) dataset included in this git repo.

In Snowsight, navigate to **Data >> Databases** and select the database.schema where the role has privileges to create a table. For example, we'll be using `SYSADMIN` to upload the dataset and create a table out of it in the schema `PUBLIC.NOTEBOOKS`. Select **Create >> Table >> From File >> Standard** in the top right, and upload the `diamonds.csv` dataset.

### Step 3 - Import the `getting_started_with_container_runtimes.ipynb` file and create a notebook

Using the `SYSADMIN` role, navigate to the **Notebooks** page on Snowsight, and select the upload button to `Import .ipynb file`.
![notebook upload](./assets/notebook_upload.png)

Fill out the creation dialog using the schema, warehouse, and compute pool set up in Step #1.

### Step 4 - Attach External Access Integrations (EAIs)

Navigate to the notebook settings via the three dots in the top right hand corner, and select the External Accesses tab. Toggle on the `allow_all_integration` EAI.
![configure EAI](./assets/eai.png)

### Step 5 - Run the notebook!

You're now ready to run the notebook! Checkout out the Notebook Markdown cells for an explanation of what is happening at each step along the way.
