Insulated Jacket,2023-12-25,"The insulated jacket is great for casual use and everyday activities during colder months due to its modern style, good warmth-to-weight ratio, ease of maintenance, and convenient storage. However, it lacks breathability and its DWR finish wears off quickly when used as an active midlayer for skiing or other strenuous activities.",0.14787486
Insulated Jacket,2023-12-25,"This insulated jacket was used for winter hiking and snowshoeing in New Hampshire's White Mountains, known for damp cold, high winds, and steep climbs. Its standout features include effective moisture management, reasonable breathability, wind blocking, athletic cut, and well-placed pockets. However, it has moderate warmth and isn't suitable for deep cold or less active pursuits, and its DwR face fabric sheds light moisture but isn't waterproof.",0.34561646
Pro Ski Boots,2023-12-25,"The reviewer selected Pro Ski Boots for their one-boot solution for resort skiing and short backcountry tours. The boots offer impressive uphill performance in walk mode, smooth range of motion for efficient skinning, and secure lock-down for ski mode. Downhill performance is excellent with powerful edge control and responsiveness. However, the boots are heavier than dedicated lightweight touring boots, causing increased fatigue on long ascents, and lack the subtle flex and comfort of lighter touring boots during extended walking, leading to foot fatigue on long tours. Overall, the boots are a strong contender for those prioritizing downhill performance in a versatile 'one-boot quiver' for resort and accessible backcountry.",0.46715015
Pro Ski Boots,2023-12-25,"After skiing in Pro Ski Boots for about 100 days over two seasons, the thermo-moldable liner has packed out, reducing precision and requiring thicker socks or booster straps.
