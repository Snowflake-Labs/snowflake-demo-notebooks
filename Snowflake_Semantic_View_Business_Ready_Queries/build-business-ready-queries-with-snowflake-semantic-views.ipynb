        "\n",
        "The **TPC-DS (Transaction Processing Performance Council - Decision Support)** benchmark is the industry-standard dataset for modeling complex decision support systems. It simulates a global retail empire with multiple sales channels including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Store sales**: Traditional brick-and-mortar retail transactions\n",
        "- **Web sales**: E-commerce transactions\n",
        "- **Catalog sales**: Mail-order catalog purchases\n",
        "- **Store returns**: Product returns and exchanges\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset includes:\n",
        "- **Dimension tables**: Store, Item, Customer, Date, Warehouse, Ship Mode, and more\n",
        "- **Fact tables**: Store Sales, Web Sales, Catalog Sales, Inventory, and Returns\n",
        "- **Scale Factor**: We're using the SF10TCL scale (10TB scale factor) from Snowflake's sample data\n",
        "\n",
        "### What We're Building\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll create a **Semantic View** that acts as a business-friendly abstraction layer over the complex TPC-DS schema. This semantic layer allows us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define relationships between tables once\n",
        "2. Create reusable metrics (aggregations, calculations)\n",
        "3. Define business-friendly dimensions\n",
        "4. Write simpler, more intuitive queries\n",
        "\n",
        "### Traditional SQL vs Semantic SQL\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll compare two approaches to querying the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Traditional SQL**: Requires explicit JOINs, table references, and aggregation logic\n",
        "- **Semantic SQL**: Uses the semantic view to abstract complexity, making queries shorter and more business-focused\n",
        "\n",
        "The queries are organized by complexity:\n",
        "- **Simple Questions**: Simple filters and selections on single or few tables\n",
        "- **Simple Questions with Aggregations**: Aggregations and metrics on simple table relationships\n",
        "- **Advanced Questions**: Simple filters across many joined tables\n",
        "- **Advanced Questions with Aggregations**: Complex aggregations across many joined tables\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's proceed to creating the Semantic View for the TPC-DS dataset."
