# Build Business-Ready Queries with Snowflake Semantic Views

Learn how to use **Snowflake Semantic Views** to simplify complex SQL queries and build business-ready analytics.

## 🚀 Overview

This demo shows how to:
1. **Create a Semantic View** over the TPC-DS benchmark dataset
2. Define **relationships, dimensions, and metrics** in one place
3. Write **simpler queries** that let Snowflake handle the complexity

**The result?** Queries that are shorter, easier to read, and maintain the same analytical power.
