## Load demo notebooks to Snowflake

The notebook files are available for download as `.ipynb` files. To load the demo notebooks into your Snowflake Notebook, follow these steps: 

1. On Github, click into each folder containing the tutorial and the corresponding `.ipynb file`, such as [this](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/notebook-demo/blob/main/My%20First%20Notebook%20Project/My%20First%20Notebook%20Project.ipynb). Download the file by clicking on the `Download raw file` from the top right.

2. Go to the Snowflake web interface, [Snowsight](https://app.snowflake.com), on your browser.

3. Navigate to `Project` > `Notebooks` from the left menu bar. 

3. Import the .ipynb file you've download into your Snowflake Notebook by using the `Import from .ipynb` button located on the top right of the Notebooks page.

4. Select the file from your local directory and press `Open`.

5. A `Create Notebook` dialog will show up. Select a database, schema, and warehouse for the Notebook and click `Create`.
