      "source": "# Getting Started with Snowflake Cortex ML-Based Functions\n\n## Overview \n\nOne of the most critical activities that a Data/Business Analyst has to perform is to produce recommendations to their business stakeholders based upon the insights they have gleaned from their data. In practice, this means that they are often required to build models to: make forecasts, identify long running trends, and identify abnormalities within their data. However, Analysts are often impeded from creating the best models possible due to the depth of statistical and machine learning knowledge required to implement them in practice. Further, python or other programming frameworks may be unfamiliar to Analysts who write SQL, and the nuances of fine-tuning a model may require expert knowledge that may be out of reach. \n\nFor these use cases, Snowflake has developed a set of SQL based ML Functions, that implement machine learning models on the user's behalf. As of December 2023, three ML Functions are available for time-series based data:\n\n1. Forecasting: which enables users to forecast a metric based on past values. Common use-cases for forecasting including predicting future sales, demand for particular sku's of an item, or volume of traffic into a website over a period of time.\n2. Anomaly Detection: which flags anomalous values using both unsupervised and supervised learning methods. This may be useful in use-cases where you want to identify spikes in your cloud spend, identifying abnormal data points in logs, and more.\n3. Contribution Explorer: which enables users to perform root cause analysis to determine the most significant drivers to a particular metric of interest. \n\nFor further details on ML Functions, please refer to the [snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/guides-overview-analysis). \n\n### Prerequisites\n- Working knowledge of SQL\n- A Snowflake account login with an ACCOUNTADMIN role. If not, you will need to use a different role that has the ability to create database, schema, table, stages, tasks, email integrations, and stored procedures. \n\n### What You\u2019ll Learn \n- How to make use of Anomaly Detection & Forecasting ML Functions to create models and produce predictions\n- Use Tasks to retrain models on a regular cadence\n- Use the [email notfication integration](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/email-stored-procedures) to send email reports of the model results after completion \n\n### What You\u2019ll Build \nThis Quickstart is designed to help you get up to speed with both the Forecasting and Anomaly Detection ML Functions. \nWe will work through an example using data from a fictitious food truck company, Tasty Bytes, to first create a forecasting model to predict the demand for each menu-item that Tasty Bytes sells in Vancouver. Predicting this demand is important to Tasty Bytes, as it allows them to plan ahead and get enough of the raw ingredients to fulfill customer demand. \n\nWe will start with one food item at first, but then scale this up to all the items in Vancouver and add additional datapoints like holidays to see if it can improve the model's performance. Then, to see if there have been any trending food items, we will build an anomaly detection model to understand if certain food items have been selling anomalously. We will wrap up this Quickstart by showcasing how you can use Tasks to schedule your model training process, and use the email notification integration to send out a report on trending food items. \n\nLet's get started!"

We can use the `series_colname` argument in the forecasting ML function, which lets a user specify a column that contains the different series that needs to be forecasted individually. \n\nFurther, there may be additional data points we want to include in our model to produce better results. In the previous section, we saw that for the Lobster Mac & Cheese item, there were some days that had major spikes in the number of items sold. One hypothesis that could explain these jumps are holidays where people are perhaps more likely to go out and buy from Tasty Bytes.

In a production setting, you may accordingly adjust the input table/view to have the most updated dataset to retrain the model.\n2. **Sending emails**: This requires you to set up an integration, and specify who the recipients of the email should be. When completed appropriately, you'll recieve an email from `no-reply@snowflake.net`, as seen below. \n3. **Formatting results**: We've made use of a snowpark stored procedure, to take advantage of the functions that pandas has to neatly present the resultset into an email. For futher details and options, refer to this [medium post](https://medium.com/snowflake/hey-snowflake-send-me-an-email-243741a0fe3) by Felipe Hoffa.\n4. **Executing the Tasks**: We have set this task to run the first of every month - if you would like to run it immediately, you'll have to change the state of the task to `RESUME` as shown in the last three lines of code above, before executing the parent task `AD_VANCOUVER_TRAINING_TASK`. Note that we have orchestrated the task to send the email to the user *after* the model has been retrained. After executing, you may expect to see an email similar to the one below within a few minutes.\n"
